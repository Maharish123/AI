   A heavy load vehicle refers to any vehicle that is designed to transport large, bulky, or heavy items that exceed the typical weight capacity of standard vehicles. These vehicles are built with robust structures, strong frames, and powerful engines to safely carry heavy loads over long distances. They are commonly used in industries like construction, logistics, mining, and agriculture.
